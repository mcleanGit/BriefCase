## Brief Description

The project begins the process of building a professional portfolio that will gradually incorporate examples of my coding work and deployed applications. My eventual goal is to complement these evolving technological outcomes with some of my existing and ongoing work in music and digital media.

Motivation. As an executive leader for many years in higher-education and innovation in the performing arts and digital media, I am driven by the socio-economic, organizational, and technological impact of these transformative fields. Now that my institutional administrative role is completed, I am reengaged in many ongoing projects in interdisciplinary research and infrastructure development. In addition to their legacy value, some of those projects also explore new horizons, in part related to my role as co-founder of Digital Media at the Crossroads (DM@X) and other networking initiatives. I am motivated to expand my circle of influence and range of capability by working from the ground up to explore the coding and implementation aspects of the digital present and future as an important complement to my executive experience in these areas.

## Specific aspects of Version-01

Project title. Portfolio-mclean.

Design. The current design is based on a requisite mock-up. Subsequent versions are likely to take quite different formats and will gradually build content.

Criteria and process. Expectations for the portfolio at this stage include developer name, photo/avatar, links to sections that provide a brief biographical note (About Me), samples of my work (Work), and contact information (Contact Me). These are navigational links. The Work section includes title images of applications. For Version-01 most of these are placeholder images and project names. They will be replaced with real applications as the portfolio is updated. The images are also stock placeholders at this time, as I continue to build a personal portfolio of suitable materials. In the Work section, as is typical, the first (currently pseudo) application receives a larger image. The Work images link to deployed applications. Again, these are placeholders at this time. The project includes preliminary efforts to ensure responsive layout, so that the page and site can be viewed on various screens and devices. These will be refined as the portfolio evolves.
